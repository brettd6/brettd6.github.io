    <h1>The San Jose Sharks</h1>
    <p>Unfortunately the last couple seasons for this NHL team haven't gone so well... After signing <strong>Erik Karlsson</strong> to an 11.5m dollar contract
    the team was unable to keep their captain, <strong>Joe Pavelski</strong>. Joe has been doing well on his new team in Dallas,
    even making the <a href=https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/sharks/joe-pavelski-going-stanley-cup-final-after-stars-eliminate-sharks-rival>finals in 2022.</a>
    At least the Sharks has a few promising rookies in <strong>Thomas Bordeleau</strong> and <strong>William Eklund</strong>, which should make 2022 interesting to watch.</p>
